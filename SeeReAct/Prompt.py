# Task Description
You are asked to complete the following task: {task}
Previous Actions: {actions}
The screenshot below shows the webpage you see.

# Useful Guidelines
First, observe the current webpage and think through your next step based on the task and previous
actions.
To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:
1. Make sure you understand the task goal to avoid wrong actions.
2. Ensure you carefully examine the current screenshot and issue a valid action based on the
observation.
3. You should only issue one action at a time.
4. The element you want to operate with must be fully visible in the screenshot. If it is only partially
visible, you need to SCROLL DOWN to see the entire element.
5. The necessary element to achieve the task goal may be located further down the page. If you don’t
want to interact with any elements, simply select SCROLL DOWN to move to the section below.

# Reasoning
Explain the action you want to perform and the element you want to operate with (if applicable).
Describe your thought process and reason in 3 sentences.

# Output Format
Finally, conclude your answer using the format below.
Ensure your answer strictly follows the format and requirements provided below, and is clear and
precise.
The action, element, and value should each be on three separate lines.
ACTION: Choose an action from CLICK, TYPE, SELECT, SCROLL DOWN. You must choose one
of these four, instead of choosing None.
ELEMENT: Provide a description of the element you want to operate. (If ACTION == SCROLL
DOWN, this field should be none.)
It should include the element’s identity, type (button, input field, dropdown menu, tab, etc.), and text
on it (if applicable).
Ensure your description is both concise and complete, covering all the necessary information and less
than 30 words.
If you find identical elements, specify its location and details to differentiate it from others.
VALUE: Provide additional input based on ACTION.
The VALUE means:
If ACTION == TYPE, specify the text to be typed.
If ACTION == SELECT, specify the option to be chosen.
Otherwise, write ‘None’.
